Each item gives the player some stats and the item hase it durability that is reduced when the player is moving. Other items that can be picked up are barrels that are consumables, and they can poison or give the player other stats. Other pickup item is an instant consumable for instance movement speed up. The consumables have a max amount of storage inside the inventory, so some can be stored up to 4 inside the same slot and some can be stored up to 8. They can be split inside the inventory so for instance 8 barrels on one slot can be split to 3 barrels on one slot and 5 barrels on the other slot.
